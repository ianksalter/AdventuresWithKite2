I'm tearful as I say goodbye to Jessica - I don't know when I'll be back.

I can't which decide whic station to gat the train to gatwick from. So in the end I select by the first bus that comes along, A 48.

With my big bag I chose to sit downstairs and sit facing backwards. I rerely do  This gives me a strange sensation that at first I can't quite picture.

Then as the bus turns from cambridge heath road I realise I am saying goodbye. First to cambridge heath road then Hack Ney Road and Shorditch church.

I am holding back the tears, until I can no longer. I search for a tissue and blow my nose as excuse for wiping my eyes.

On shordtich high street I see the familiar figure of my daughter Tegan just yards away. I knock on the window but to no avail.

So I ring her and we chat as she too recedes into the distance. It turns out she has been on the same bus. We were so close, just meters from each other but now we get farther apart by the second.

We end our breif call saying our goodbyes and I stare out of the window as we pass the bottleneck that is liverpool street station.

The bus heads further south and I feel as if the great boa constrictor that is Londing is un curling herself from me.

WE pass leaden Hall market to my right and soon we are out over the expanse that is the river thames. London bridge is not my favorite river crossing.

I prefere the view from Waterloo Bridge where London's two component cities, those of Westminster and London herself displare their jewels for all to see. Where you

can see both St Pauls and The Houses of Parliment. I make do with just the sights of the city. To the left I can see the dom of St Pauls but to my right is the tower and Tower bridge. I suppose this is apt as I have speant far more time here.

Before I know it the bus has reached its terminus and another starting point for me London Bridge Station.
After checking the Citymapper app I navigate the station to platfom 4. The architecture, where I have got lost many times during and after the recent construction, is finally become clearer to me, though I may never be back.

Starting to enjoy the sensation, I sit backwards on the Thameslink train and watch as LOndon contineues to unwind it self from me through

its concentric rings of development. The georgian gives way to the victorian, the edwardian, the endless expanse of near identical in ter war semi detached hosing to new cevelopments bringing us into the modern century.

We cross the M25 and the North Downs receed from my view. I disembark at gatwake, make my way to the North Terminal via the shuttle.

I use the automatic bag drop and am soon through security.

THough I don't want to I use the the Weatherspoons as there really isnt another option for my pre fligh prosecco.

I get through the waiting and am soon embarked and watching the UK trecede from me below. Aptly, as this was the last place Kite and I spent significant time in the UK, I can see Brighton below through the twlight, as we head out accross the english chanel and in to the clouds.

Once again the infligh film on my tablet finishes as we start our approach into Valencia.

Formalities are over quickley and soon I am sitting in a taxi back to the marina. An expensive luxory I think, but hey what the hell, its christmas eve.
