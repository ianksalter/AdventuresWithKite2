It is 6:30 am I need the loo. Its been a rough day or so in Almerimar and now I am up early to fix more stuff. I get up and, on the way to the loo, I roll a cigarette. I put it to my mouth but the liter dies. On the long walk back it starts to rain. Of course I don't have my sailing jacket. This doesn't bode well.

Our time here started off well enough. Our marina staff helped us move to a mediteranian moring. (explain 30% more boats)
