The marina promises us a lift out

The next morning we inspect the steering gear and fix

At around lunch time a marinerio comes over and tells us to head to the slipway for a lift out. 

Chris concern about the rudder.

It is siesta time when a low loader tuns up with a boat on the back. Shifting the Mast

Working times - 8 til 4

Spanish 8 till 2 and 4:30 til 7 ???

At Three we head off for lunch and I cant help but think now might be a good time to talk about Yanis Vafoukakis and changing the narrative.

The traditonal narrative

at around 4:45


In the evening we return for more tapas and while I think about the narative what Vafoukakis is proposing

CIRCULAR FLOW DIAGRAM

I wake early on Friday morning and think that there is so much more to Vafoukakis argument. This has to do with open source software.

Maybe just talk about open source movement and do the detail in another whole section.

Richard Stalman Free Software MOvement

Eric Raymond Open Software Movement - The Catheradal and the  Bazar

Linus Torsveld - Linux

Out of these developments. Apple OXS is based upon free BSD

Googles Android is based upon Linux.

Most websites run on the Apachae software foundation

So one can argue that community is at the very heart of software developments

At 8am I spy Chris walking into the yard and walk with him to his office/ shop

He says I'm handy am I a builder - no I say but I have some building experiance but my actual job was as a Senior architect for JP Morgan.

Acid 

Cris has been kind you know we are going to pay you for this but is there anything we can do to help around the yard for your kindness. You know IT could you get my till display to work.

Sp on Friday I spend the day looking at manuals play with settings and reinstalling software on Chrises Till compouter by the end of the day I ave the software connected.

On Saturday morning I mix writing with working on the boat and looking up wasy to solve Chris's software problem.


Ride into El Ejido  The hill, the Snow Capped Sierra Nevada and the fields of Plastic.

The Orange shop

Thank you Hansome.

I stop for a decafe cofee and some water.

The ride back. Meeting Riff and Raff

I try and clean the boat but the wind I get some is too much so I press on with my writing

The wind is still strong on Sunday so I get on with more writing and make final preperations to help Chris in the morning.
