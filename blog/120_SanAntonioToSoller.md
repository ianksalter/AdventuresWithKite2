Maybe add the stuff from San Antonio

NEED STUFF re affordability argument spread accross this.

Stuff about engine checks and raw water

Up until now leaving med moorings has been easy just point Kite forward with engines on remove the forward lines, remove one aft line get the last line down to a turn - flick the engine into neutral to remove the final line and then motor out between the boats.

As we get down to the last line Kite veers into the space on the starboard side. With help from our neighbours we fend off and get Kite straight out and into the bay.

Soon all our fenders are stored and lines away and we head out into the med from San Antonio Bay.


All of a sudden there is a beep that I hevent heard before. It is urgent and insistent. It's the engine. I ask Martin to check the raw water outlet. There is no water. I switch the engine off and we can smell oil smke and burning.

Quickly I haul out the fore sail to give us some means of propulsion..

Engine coolant gone and raw water system empty.

Fill engine with water and also prime the raw water system and switch the engine on. Head back to San Antonio to give engine a through check. Radio.

Taking lines - Martin comments how well we do.

Leave a second time. Get sails up and make slow progress for a couple of hours.

Wind dies totally. Switch engine on and Kite motors happily for an hour

-> Leaving Ibiza island behind. 

As three old friends we sit in the cockpit enjoying the sunshine. Carine rests with he back against the coach roof. I'm recling on the cockpit seat and Martin is perched on one of the seats at the back of the boat. 

That maybe why he notices the flow of water first.

We drop the bathing platform water is gushing out. It takes me a while to figure out that its th automatic bildge pump

-> we pump and then sponge out water from the bildge

Water in a boat is not a good thing (mention problem with the heating preasure valve)


Options:

1) water went into the boat when engine overheated
2) water is from the heating preasure valve
3) The engine is somehow pumping water maybe due to a leak
4) We have a hole in the boat

taste the water - salty this rules out 2.

We sail when we can and motor when we can waiting for the promised wind from the South East. Carine makes dinner -> quesey. With the sun setting we reach Ibizas north coast and the wind finally comes 12 knots from the south east (beam reach) 

I set the sails and head dwn into my port aft cabin to get some warm clothes on. I step down in the angled corner of the cabin to maibtain my balance as I change and to my suprise my sock gets wet. I look down and ther is water in my cabin. I look under the flor into the bildges and see that there is loads of water.

martin does sterling work bailing it out.

While the wind picks up, we heal over more. I roll away the foresail and then put in a reef as the wind climbs to 17 knots. All the time martin bails bucket after bucket of water. 

Carne fals asleep in the center bunk while Martin bails. Hard work and sick making of but tiredhe sawps with Carine and she doses in the cockpit.

Martin Thatcher -> no such thing as society. Martin wakes and carine goes down to sleep. Martin and I sit chatting about what the problem might be.

I hear an unusual splash in the water

Dolphins and phosperessence.

Despite a moonless sky clearly visible in the clear blue of the med as they lay with the boat.

Martins joy ->

    me worrying about sailing

Carrine and Martin Swap. I grab small ten minute snatches of sleep in the cockpit 

Sunrise -> wind dies as we hit the north coast of Mallorca 
Sunrise -> A chance to look at the engine again. 

Back of the engine behind the engine compartment - water is bursting out

Switch the engine off and sail while Martin and I reattach the pipe. Contiortionism not helped by cramp as we slacken the jubilee clips and reorientate the hose.

Finally we are finished and restart the engine. No leaks -> High Fives

martin and I bail while we sail along picked up wind. Stuff about forbidding ness of north coasts.

Fnaly the entrance to Soller hoves into view. with high clifs all around (check images)The bay looks like nothing more than a crater, though the baleric islands do not have volcaninc origin (look up geology on wikipedia) We radio ports IB who have a single pontoon which is southernmost. We are soon mored and I head off to the office with our paperwork. Ports IB have my details from other marinas but I still have to fill in a form in triplicate

Gibson -> future is already here, its just not evenly distributed. Toilets and not working (and there is no water on the pontoon) So we have a scratch unch in a cafe and after we shpwer on the boat and catch up on sleep.
