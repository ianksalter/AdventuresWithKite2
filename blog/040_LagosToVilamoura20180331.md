# Lagos to Vilamoura (Saturday 31st March 2018) #

Next morning we are up early

Get all the batons and are almos t there apart from the final bolt. We head to the marina office so that we can check out and Silliam and Smiler can add their passports.

Then we hit the supermarket and stock up on food then the chandlers where I buy an expensive pair of alum keys

Next day


We ruch round the boat getting things ready 

I take of the instrument covers and lift the removeable center of the cockpit table, so that I can stash them for the journey and there, of course, are the two alum keys that we are missing. Never mind I think it is god to have a back up alum key.

hear anothe r boat make a request to have the bridge opened. At 10:30 The wind is southerly time taken to explain stuff on the boat. 

I take off the front fenders but I let Silliam remove the rest

Smiler turns the boat head to wind wihile silliam and I haul up the mainsail 

Smiler's father keeps a sail boat in Turkey and has raced dingies so is a competent sailor. He becomes the person to fiddle with the sails adjusting them to try and get that extra litle bit of performance. 

Liam's only experiance has been as crew on a boat from the Azores to Falmouth, but he works as a rigger at festivals and for theatres and learns fast. 

We pass the algarve towns on the way. Portimao. Albuferia both of which I know from sailing training last year. Finaly we get close to Vilamoura and spot the marina enterance. Once we get close we turn the boat into the wind.
