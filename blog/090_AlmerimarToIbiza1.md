Heading


Given our previous experiance, we leave Almerimar marina the second time very gingerly.  We notice on the way out that the line of port hand cans has been moved closer to the center of the chanel making the channel narrower. The can where we hit the beech sticks out a bit more.

We get out and into deeper water and point the nose to Ibiza, set the engine to 2000 revs and we are on ut way (WIND IN THE WRONG DIRECTION???). I make tea and porridge and soon we are both feeling good. 

The wind is around 10 knots at about 25 degrees to the port so we rais the main and unfurl the fore sale and soon are touching 7 knots, not exactly in the direction we wish to go but at least we have the engine off and are sailing.

After a couple of hours the wind dies and we are back on the motor up to Cabo de Gata, literally the Cape of the Cat. Riff goes down for a sleep and after a bit the wind picks up, this time at about 50 degrees to the starboard (bow). Again the ofresail is unfurled and we are sailing in light winds at about 6 knots. Whe  Riff wakes I tell him that I think the cleaning and the anti-foul has given us an extra half a knot of speed. This should save us 2 hours in every 24. This time I go down for a siesta. By the time I wake the wind has died and the motor is on again. A quick check of the weatherfore cast indicates that we will probably be motoring for the next 18 hours.

The eastern med is notorious for having no wind or too much wind, or if its the right amount, it will be heading straight at you. One of my French frriends from Lisbon described it as a washing machine. One sailor friend asked me if I knew what t do if all my navigation instruments failed in the med. I said no expecting some pearl of wisdom. He replies "Just point your boat into the wind because that is where you will need to go"

As the sun gets lower I make a stew which we eat while witnessing a magnificent sunset. I witness a lighthouse flashing which we identify as XXX because it has 4 flashes in a 20 second period. Riff disapears below and comes back with a bar of salted caramel chocolate. I suggest that it mght be time for a rum ration. This used to be a navel tradition (see wikipedia, mention my dad). Riff and I sit nibbling the chocolate and sipping the rum as the stars come out around us. Feeling warmed by both the chocolate and the rum I head down for a sleep and Riff takes first watch.

TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGE ARGUMENT

I come up to take my watch and riff heads down to sleep. There is a parade of big ships passing on our starboard side. Logial due to traffic seperation systems. As a smaller vessel we are travelling through the inshore traffic zones at both capes so are well to the inside of these vessels. A Nic Warren mix is almost at the end but I restart it. 

As I sit staring out at the sea. My mind wanders to the field of complexity economics. I first encountered sugarscape in Eric Beinhoffers excelent book.

I check my watch and its time to take a log. With the wind ahead of us at 8 knots Kite seems to have slowed by about a knot. Nevermind we were making good progress earlier. We will probably still make our waypoint of Cabo de XXXX at arround midday tomorrow.

I drift off and remember waking in Lisbon at some unearthly hour and thinking of sugarscape and basic income. I could code the notion of basic income into sugarscape and see its impact, Search the web to find that it has already been done/
