##BIST: The Environmental Argument##

A simple model of the economy is the [Circular Flow of Income](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_flow_of_income):

![Circular Flow of Income](../images/CircularFlowOfIncome.jpg)

Here Households provide Labour to Businesses in return for the income in the form of wages, whereas Businesses provide Goods and Services for income in the form of Consumer Expenditure. 

The idea can be traced back to [Richard Cantillon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon) but in many ways came to the fore with the work of [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes) in particular his work [The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money).

Keynes was writing in the 1930's and his principal concern was the [The Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression), that period of economic collapse that had followed the 1929 stock market crash and had led to mass unemployment across the the world. Keynes sought to demonstrate that the amount of income in the circular flow of income could settle at a number of different equilibrium and that in particular in the 1930's the equilibrium was well below full employment. He identified a number of actions that inject money into the economy:

* Investment
* Government Expenditure

There are opposite actions that withdraw money from the economy:

* Saving
* Taxation

Keynes argued that it was possible to move the circular flow of income to a new equilibrium by increasing the injections and reducing the withdrawals, thereby reducing unemployment. His approach provided an justification for governments to run a deficit where taxation fell short of government expenditure in order to stimulate the economy.
