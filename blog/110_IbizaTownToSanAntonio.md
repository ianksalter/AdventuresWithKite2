We have decided to leave Ibiza town and head for cheaper moorings.

I'm up early so head off to find a supermarket for provisions..

Once back I wake Riff and head off to the Marina office to pay our extortionate fee. It takes 40 minutes to pay.

When I get back to the boat both Riff and I are keen to leave.

Freu Grande (NOTE) Once through the gap we are away from the traffic.

In particular Isla Vedra (????) rises like a cathedral while the neighbouring Isla Vedranell (????) looks like a rectory.

I check the pilot guide and find that there is an inshore passage we can take between these les and the coast.
