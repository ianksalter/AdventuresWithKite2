# Sines to Lagos (Tuesday March 2th to Wednesday March 28th 2018) #

Swiming in Sines (see notebook)


I reflect back on the security


We tend to theink there are all these barriers that stop us from doing things but most like that are ilusary.


Ian's boat drifts in - > with the marinherio. Get talking to Ian about how he came to the boat life. 

I end up discussing my sail problem with dutch tim from the next boat down. Time thinks I should try sewing a solution and I an tends to agree. I'm keen to try my. 


At seven pm, an hour before sunset I leave. As Im leaving the bay of Sines I get my gfenders a=then turn myself north west, slow the endine and raise the main. I haven't gone far when I look up to see that the new car has seperated itself from the sail, proving that you can fix all things with cable ties and gaffer tape. As the sail is prettyu useless there is not much I can do, so I decide to pack it away and continue on the engine. This is most of the sailing work with none of the sailing fun. I curse my bad luck but as I sit in the boat moving gentely if somewhat noisily through the waves under the moonlit sky I realize that I can't really complain about luck at all. I am enormusly lucky to be able to be free to have the sea and the time in whch to travel on Kite.

With no sails up there is not much today so in my mind I expand on the second topic of freedom the freedom ov movement.  

I really want to think about freedom of movement in two ways, moving in space and moving in time.

European freedom of movement in the EU sense





Freedom of Movement more generally accross the planet. How could we let people move freely accross the planet.

    How do we stop everyone living on the same spot on the planet. Concentrations of wealth and people.
    
       The very nature of our world that our identites tie us to a particular place passport to a country and a nationality



Freedom of Movement in Time -> the big freedom - we are tied not only by an address but also by employment.


At 4.15 the moon blinking. -> see notebok for the rest of the stuff.



Coming into the reception pontoon - no fenders.

Discussion of the berths.

Into my berth with a help of a feail german ssaailor.
