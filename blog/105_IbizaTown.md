Nothing open 

Riff goes back to sleep

Eventually the folks from the fuel station arrive.

I need the loo and head round the back of the office complex to the retaurant. 

I have a decaf coffee and a sparkling water and sit staring accross the bay to iIbiza town. It feels good to be here.

This feeling soon goes as we discover how expensive the marina is - more tna ten times what we have been paying.


Fro  the fuel pontoon I manage to ring around and get a spot which is half the price.

More with diffculty scrathing the gel coat

Shower then sleep till 4

Get the gel coat out and fix (describe process) NOTE

Riff and I head into Ibiza town

First a beer, then we head up towards the castle. Bean bags on steps, caa and beer staring over the town.

Head back into twn eating cheaply away from the tourist spots.

On the way back pop into a bar and watch el classico.
