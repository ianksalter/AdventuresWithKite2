The sun starts to set on Villa Real de San Antonio for our last night here. By morning its gridded streets and indeed Portugal will be gone from our lives. Riff and I stare at the water. It is low tide but we are not happy. We are worried about the flow.

*I enter the hospital from the Smithfield side. I pass through the entrance, I notice the Church of St Bartholomew the Less to my left, before emerging into the the main courtyard. In the sunlight this place is stunning. Benches sit in dappled shade. My destination is across the courtyard in the Cardiology Ward of the King George the Fifth building. I'm headed for an heart procedure that will check my arterial blood flow.*

Around high and low tides is a period know as slack water when there is minimal tidal flow. The marina at Vila Real de San Antonio is in a river and the tidal flows are significant, strong enough to make it difficult to get out without hitting another boat. So we have decided to leave at slack water, which today should be just after 8pm. Since 7:30 Riff and I have been studying the water, looking for the best opportunity to leave. We set our lines to slip so we can make an easy get away and are soon joined by a marinheiro who offers to help. We tell him we are waiting for slack water and he promises to return later.

*The inside of the building provides a sharp contrast with it's 18th century exterior. I am standing in a very modern and quite spectacular atrium. As I look up with wonder I am approached and asked if I need help. I make my way to the third floor, register with reception, and as I sit, I notice the sign: Barts Heart Center Catheterisation Suite. Catheterisation sounds painful.*

Twenty minutes after low tide the water seems to have slowed. With the help of the marinheiro we pull in our lines and reverse off the visitors pontoon turning to starboard between two rows of boats. I put Kite into forward and we cruise out through the marina entrance. The marinheiro lets us know that he is impresses with our skills. I glow warmly inside. His last words as we head down stream are to us warn us to stay in the middle of the marked channel at the mouth of the river. We obey his instructions and are soon, once again, at sea. 

*I look up from my book as my name is called. I'm taken through ominous double doors along a corridor into the room where they will prepare me for my procedure. The room is white and the chairs are the purple and yellow that seems to be a motif of the building. I change into a hospital gown. Two medics fuss about me. One inserts a cannula into my left arm while the other checks about medical allergies. I'm asked about recreational drug use and I respond truthfully. The medics show some surprise. Finally the doctor who will perform the procedure comes to seek my consent. I'm warned of the potential complications which include heart failure and death. He mentions odds of 1 in 1000. In my mind I hope those odds are for any problem, as 1 in a 1000 for death doesn't sound that great.*

We get the main sail up and with the wind coming from the North and Kite heading South East down the Spanish Coast, we are soon on a pleasant run. Riff and I eat some dinner and chat a little but mostly just stare out to sea and up at the stars taking in the majesty of a night sail. It gets to around midnight and Riff agrees to take the first watch so I go down to the center bunk. I find it difficult to sleep and I don't find slumber till around 1am.

*Once the fuss is over I get a few minutes to myself which I use to ponder on what is to come. All too soon they come to fetch me for the short walk down the corridor. The procedure room is as different from the corridor as the inside of the building was from the outside. I feel I have jumped another two hundred and fifty years. In the center of the room is the most familiar object, the operating table. At one end a huge bracket comes down from the ceiling supporting an array of monitors the like of which I have only seen on a trading floor. I give up mentally trying to describe the tech as I become aware of the sheer number of people in the room. Little old me has in excess of 10 people involved in what is about to happen. There are 5 or so in the main room but more in a barely glimpsed, glazed anti-room off to the side.* 

My alarm goes off at three but Riff, who is happy looking at the stars, suggests I sleep for another hour. I jump at the chance and so it is around ten to four that I finally climb into my waterproof coat and put on my life jacket. I come up top to a clear and moonless sky with the a very visible milky way. Riff passes me the handheld radio and tells me that he has seen three shooting stars. As he heads down to the center bunk to sleep I think on the lyrics of the Billy Bragg song:


> *I saw two shooting stars last night*

> *I wished on them but they were only satellites*

>*It's wrong to wish on space hardware*

>*I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care*


>*I don't want to change the world*

>*I'm not looking for a new England*

>*I'm just looking for another girl*

I think on the last three lines and figure that they couldn't be further from the truth for me. I'm not looking for a girl at all but I am looking for a new England and I do want to change the world. In a way this scares me, but if I am to be truly free, if I am to will the freedom of others, it is something that I feel must be done. I check that there is no traffic in our vicinity, roll myself a cigarette, pull up my pad of graph paper and draw some axis. In graphs I sketch out an idea.

*I'm led to the operating table. I climb up and lie down. My right wrist is shaved. I feel like an ape at a 23rd century veterinary practice. I'm attached to a variety of monitors. A bag of Midazolam is connected to my cannula. My right arm is rests in a bracket awaiting the beginning of the procedure. The staff begin to don lead based protection.*

There is nothing particularly original about the idea of Basic Income and Simple Tax (see Appendix 1), however I believe it offers the ability to grant human beings a great freedom; the freedom to move in time. It has the potential to free us from the cage of employment, from wage slavery as it were. I have discussed Basic Income and Simple Tax with many people over the years but I have never felt more strongly about it than I do now. In the coming days of sailing I want to develop the arguments to in support of this mechanism, tell the stories to illustrate that this idea not only brings massive potential benefits but is also very easy to implement.

*I stare upwards. My left arm feels a cool sensation as the midazolam begins to flow. My right arm feels contrastingly warm as a catheter wire is inserted through the wrist and into an artery before being guided towards my heart. The wire is used to inject a contrast agent that can be picked up by the xray machine. A plastic box on the end or a robot arm dances to an electronic whir above my chest. The doctor looks up at the monitors with some concern. A medic is swiftly by my side asking me to lift my tongue. I feel two quick sprays and taste nitroglycerin, the active ingredient on my recent constant companion. My vital signs must be looking better as the medics around me seem to relax. My robot companion continues its dance moves around my chest.*

I look up from my graphs to study the plotter. It shows a tanker ahead of us to our port side. I check it's details, we are catching it up but will pass it safely. A while later, off the port side, I see the light that marks the entrance to the Guadalquivir river, which we could take all the way up to Seville. I reflect on the choices we make and in particular the choice I have made to talk about tax and benefits in tales about sailing. I'm really not sure how well its going to work. I reassure myself that any writing works as long as it flows.

*The robot dance comes to an end. I feel a long thin snake being hauled out through my right arm. I think I overhear the words "no obstruction" from the ante-room. I feel a clamping sensation on my wrist. On the other side my cannula is disconnected from the midazolam. A medic stands ready to support me as I step down from the table. I feel fine to walk but I am usshered into a wheelchair anyway. I stare down at the clamp on my wrist. This I will have to wear for a few hours to make sure there is no arterial bleeding. This time is passed in a recovery room where I am given food and coffee. I have my book and some music so the hours are soon gone and the nurse arrives with my discharge papers. I'm told officially that there are no arterial obstructions. My clamp is replaced with a dressing and before I know it I'm once again walking through the sun dappled courtyard.*
 
 Later the sun starts to rise. The wind is still to the North and we are still heading South East. The waves are about 2 meters high and coming from the west so Kite rolls in the morning sunshine. We are approaching Cadiz. There is very little shipping, I see only the tug Obama, whose name makes me smile as it heads out to sea. As we get close to the port I wake Riff and we get the sails down and fenders out. He takes the helm and expertly manoeuvres Kite all the way onto the reception pontoon at Marina Puerto America.
