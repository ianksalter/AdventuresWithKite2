# La Linea To Ibiza (Monday 23rd to Tuesday 24th April 2018) #

We set off on a three and a half day sail. 

Steer our way through the  cargo ships and tankers

Round Europa point at the very tip of Gibratler


Head t wind and rais the main sail. Not much wind so we motor and I go down for a sleep leaving Riff and Raff on Watch.

I get maybe half an hour when a noise coming from the sail, which is getting pushed side to side by a mixture of changable winds behind us and the 3m waves.

We have heald the main sail is held in the center of the boat so this really shouldnt be a problem. We discuss what we can do and finally decide to reef.

Reefing process. 

White and yellow (first reef) and white and green (seconf reef lines). I let out the halyard while the crew haul in the reefing lines.

The half an hour sleep has just had the effect of taking the edge of my tiredness and I don't think I can sleep again so I stay up on deck. Eventually theRiff and Raff head down to get some sleep.

I start thinking of another argument for basic income. One I'd seen in a speech by Yanis Varoufakis, the former greek finance minister, but before I get a chance to gather my thoughts I notice that the wind has picked up to 8 knots and come round from our stern.

This is sailing weather so I point Kite head to wind and shake out the reefs on the main to see if we can sail. Once this is done we are making 3 knots without the motor, really not enough. So, I decide to take out the kite. With no crew this  is risky but in the light winds we should be ok.


-> Getting out the Kite process

Once this is done and we are sailing blissfully again I sit in the the cockpit, in the quiet of the night with my writing pad in front of me about to start on the Yanis Varoufakis argument for Basic Income when the wind seems to die a little, the kite becomes unpredictible and then twists in on itself.

I decide to take it down and continue on the motor. As I'm on my own I give the kites sheet some slack before I head forward, but by the time I get there the kite has managed to wrap itself round the fore stay. I manage to unfurl the sail from the stay, but when I try to pull down on the control lines to bring the snuffler down I realise that the sail is now tangled around the control lines and are not budging.

At this point I am dripping with sweat. I really need to get the kite into its bag but the halyard is lead back to the cockpit. This whol job is much easier with two people. I consider waking the crew, but it has only been a couple of hours since they went down to sleep. I head back give the halyard about a meter of slack then develop a technique of gradulary lowering the halyard by using a cleat on the mast. This enables me to get the ssail back into its back. Once this is done relieved and damp from all the sweat I head back to the cockpit. I'm just considering Yanis Varoufakis again when I hear a noise from the mainsail. Something sounds badley wrong. I clip on and head upto the mast to see in dawns early light that the eyebolt (CHECK name!!!)holds the mainsal tack is swinging free. THis should be tightened onto the bolt that holds the mainsail to the mast so I'm more than a little concerned. This time I do wake the crew to help me get the mainsheet down. After a cup of tea, in real daylight I get out the socket set and tighten the nut onto the eyebolt. The wind now is changable so we decide to motor with the mainsheet down. 

I have always tried to give love and attention to the people and things that I love. The pessimist in me sometimes thinks that when things are really important I fail to notice and am not there. On the voyage to La Linea Riff had pointed out that the leisure battery indicator seemed to be looking low- but I don't really pay this enough attention.

It was something I could have looked at with all that time in Gibraltar, but what with feeling down and illness, I hadn't got around to it. 

WE seem to be having the same problem now. I look at the battery connections and they look badley corroded. I talk with the crew - maybe not getting a good enough connection so I decide to clean them.

Sweaty in the cabin in the heat of the day I take of the connections and replace them (thankfully I avoid the nausea.)


Doesn't seem to have worked even though we have the engine on the battries voltage continues to drop and gradually our instruments start failing. This is clearly something that we can't fix at sea so I study the pilot guide and select Almerimar as our next port of call.

Sailors train for this and have multiple back ups. If the worst comes to the worse we can navigate by our paper charts and the magnetic compass, when we get near to the coas we can take sights on landmarks and use the bearings on these sights to give us our position. WE halso have the battery operated handheld that will give us GPS coordinates. On approach we use the Navionics app on the Android tab;et - though the tablets magnetic field has a profound efect on the compass - shifting it by 60 degrees.
