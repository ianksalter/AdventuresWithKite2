# Oerias to Sines (Monday 26th March 2018) #

I'm reclining in Kites rear starboard corner, steering with my foot. In front of me the sun climbs over the Portuguese coast, its reflection creating a river of silver of which I seem to be the source. The rushing and faffing that comes with the start of a sail is done with. I have had a cup of tea. The world is perfect. 

I'm just thinking about what possible image I can choose to describe the way I'm feeling when perfect gets more perfect. The phone rings, my daughter Maxime. I get to share my morning joy with her while she shops for her dinner after a long day at work in Sydney. We finish updating each other on our lives and the call ends. The silver river is still there and I go back to thinking of images.

As I write about my journeys I have got into the habit of choosing an image to go with each tale........  




leads to discussion of what art I can and cant use.

Stoty of paper I wrote for the festschrift.

Wind change again

Motoring - boordom - sickness
