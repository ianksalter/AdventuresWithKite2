We leave Cadiz at around 5:30pm. Sails are soon out and we are making progress. We are sailing South East The wind is in the West but we are expecting it to back round to the North and then North East through the course of the night. Time is important as we need to arrive at the Straits of Gibraltar in time to catch the tide. This does mean that we will arrive at the start of the straights in darkness. This has a small risk as, at this time of year, there are whales in the the straights. I would love to see a whale or two but at a bit of a distance. A collision with Kite could be disastrous.

*As I wait for the cab I look down at my stuff. There isn't much and what there is is old and tired, a bit like me really. I don't know why I agreed to go to this festival, my heart isn't really in it. I'm as keen as my camping gear is up to date. My once majestic festival tent, complete with sunroof and side ventilation that makes it possible to sleep during the day, is not what it once was. The zip to the main entrance was broken at Nowhere in 2016, a festival that also covered it in dust. My sleeping bag also has a broken zip. Hopefully the airbed will stay up. Never mind, if all else fails, I know how to zone out and pretend everything is ok.* 

Two hours out of Cadiz we estimate that we are going too slowly and so decide to take out the kite. We heft this tricksy sail out of the main cabin and forward towards the prow of the boat. We soon have all the lines attached and have it hoisted inside it's snuffler. Using the control lines we raise the snuffler up the mast and the sail billows. Our speed increases to a healthy six and a half knots. This lasts for a bit but then the sail seems to loose the wind. We play with the sheet, the line that leads back to the cockpit, but to no avail. I go forward. It looks like the leech (or front) of the sail is not catching the wind properly so I decide double up on the tack line that leads from the bottom front corner of the sail, the tack, to the front of the boat. This seems to work and soon we are touching 7 knots with our sails filled.

*We arrive and lug our stuff to the entrance where we join the back of the queue. A queue, when was the last time I queued for a festival. Oh hang on when was the last time I was a punter at a festival. I've been working in one form or another, usually build and take down, since I don't know when. Normally I have stuff to do at events like this. The next three days yawn in front of me. What will I possibly do for all that time? After what seems like and age, we are through the festival gates and find our friends who have saved us some space. I get my tent up quickly as the light fades. I don't stay up late. At dawn I awake with my back, arms amd legs touching the floor through the deflated airbed. I reach for the air bed pump and then zone out, drifting back to sleep with a gentle breeze of escaping air cooling my face in the already hot morning, while the remaining air cuddles me as I sink back to the floor.*  

We sit down to eat dinner. The autopilot is set so that Kite steers to the wind. As wind direction starts to come round to the North, Kite heads away from our planned course towards the West. We let this happen for a while watching the stars as they come out around us. Eventually it makes sense to gybe. I bring down the control lines on the snuffler while Riff gently lets out the sheet. We center the main sail and then turn Kite towards the West until the wind is coming over the Starboard side at 150 degrees. We let the main out and retie the gybe preventer. We swap the kite over to the port side of the boat raise the snuffler and are soon making about six and a half knots. I look up to see that we are due west of the light at Cabo Trafalger. I ease Kite onto a more easterly course and reflect that one of my relatives must have passed this way over two hundred years ago. 

My great, great, great, great, grandfather Jo Pardy would no doubt have sailed through here on the [HMS Bellerophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bellerophon_(1786)), one of the ships of [Nelson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson) fleet, on their way to engage the French at the [Battle of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile). My family generally agrees that old Jo was probably drinking in some navel watering hole when the [kings shilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_shilling) was dropped into his beer. I still posses the medals he was awarded and it is hard not to think of him when sailing through the waters where Nelson, both in victory, and on the Victory, ultimately met his end. Riff is taking the first watch. As I curl up to sleep in the main cabin I wonder what old Jo would make of his distant relatives sailing adventures.

*Even through my glum I can see that this festival is beautiful. The decor and the lighting is amazing. The people are respectful, almost to burner standards. There is virtually none of the trash build up that I associate with commercial events. Despite this, the cynic in me recoils. I feel like I'm in a theme park, maybe its just because I'm not working, I'm not part of making the magic happen. It's evening and I'm sitting with an old friend talking about how I feel. She draws my attention to a fire performer remarking on the beauty of his art. I surprise even myself with my response: "It's just a boy with a stick crying: 'look at me mummy'"*

At around 3am I wake to the sound of the main sheet pulling against the gybe preventer. I head up to take over from Riff. The wind has come round to the North East but also dropped to around 4 knots. Kite is moving at around 1 knot, not enough to make the tides in the straights. We take the decision to turn on the engine. Riff helps me take Kite down before heading down to the main cabin for his rest.

*I have to admit that many of my friends are party people who see a festival as a chance for prolonged intoxication and dancing. I'm not sure I can do that for three days straight anymore, so on Saturday, my friend from the previous night becomes my guardian angel, and for the first time in my life I attend a workshop at a festival. In fact I attend two. We watch the England world cup game in a beautifully relaxed atmosphere high on a hill. The evening brings deep conversations with another friend that lift my spirit. Before bed my guardian angel and I agree to take a hot tub in the morning and, most unlike me, I agree to do it naked.*

With the engine on and Kite running on auto pilot there is really not much to do except keep a look out for other shipping, an easy task on this clear night with all Kites electronics functioning. I start thinking about other things. I have promised myself that over the coming nights I will flesh out a number of arguments in favour of Basic Income and Simple Tax (BIST). Tonight I want to focus on simplicity (See Appendix 1). I pull up the pad in which I have written notes on the UK Tax system for 2017/18. I also pull up my graph pad. I start work and after a short while I am done happy with a graph that shows the impact of income tax on various levels of income. I look up and see an Orange glow coming from over Kite's starboard side. I check the charts and realise I'm seeing light pollution from Tanger in Morroco. I stare down at the pad again. Next I will focus on National Insurance.

* I get there early but it's not long before my guardian angel arrives. We wash under cold water and are soon naked in a hot tub. To say I feel vulnerable without clothes would be an understatement but soon these feelings subside. Others join us in the tub, we drink prosecco and I relax and enjoy the experience, at least I do for 45 minutes. Suddenly I start to feel way to hot. I wan't to get out but it seems rude so I stay for the full hour. By the time we really do get out I'm feeling really weak. We had planned to do some classes but I really don't have the energy so I excuse myself and go and lie back in my tent. With the sun roof and sides open I rest in the shade. This is how I pass most of the morning zoning out.*

With the National Insurance Graph drawn, I look at the plotter and realise that we are approaching the red sector lights at Tarrifa. These warn us off shallows and wrecks to our port side. To our starboard side is the traffic separation system for the Gibraltar Straights. I change course to head Kite across the inshore traffic zone between the big ships and the shallows. With the tankers and cargo vessels coming the other way it fee cls a bit like walking down a narrow pavement while facing the oncoming traffic. I take the log and realise that we are catching the tides as we planned and now Kite is making 8 knots. I think briefly about Employers National Insurance contributions but with time pressing realise that I can ignore them for the current reflections. Right now I must tackle Universal Credit.

*Someones future social media post will include a picture of me and one of my best friends. He sits in the foreground, happy and smiling. I lean in the background with a face like thunder. It captures pretty much how I feel. I'm the sad ape in the corner while all the other apes are happy and dancing. I think to myself that I'm just one species of 7 billion apes. A species so successful that we now hold the future of the planet in our hands. As the dance floor gasps in awe as the confetti cannons explode, I'm thinking how do we keep 7 billion of us occupied without wrecking the place. In my despair and old friend sidles up and manages to give me some sparkle and all of a sudden I'm up and dancing like the other apes.  Later when the dancing has stopped my raggedy tent with it's single dimming torch hanging from center becomes a palace of laughter and I feel for the first time since my cab ride I might be enjoying myself.*

Sunrise will be a while but it has already started getting light. Kite is heading due East and I can can clearly see the coasts of Africa to the South and Europe to the North. There are no signs of any whales. My mind starts to wander but I make myself regain focus. I pick up my pad of graph paper and decide to draw one more graph. I want to see the effect tax, national insurance and universal credit have on initial income. When I'm done I lean back and look at the picture. I'm stunned by what I see. What I have looks like a badly version of the Basic Income Simple Tax graph from our previous night sail. I have indeed shown that BIST is much much simpler than the current UK system. 

*It's light, about five in the morning, when the pain comes first. It's a crushing sensation in my chest that forces me from the tent. I'm on all fours, dry retching, the pain in my chest feels stronger and my arms are tingling. When the pain is at its worst I cry for a medic but all are asleep. Gradually the pains subside and I crawl back to my deflated bed exhausted. I wake again at nine desperate for the loo. Though there is a certain urgency, on the hundred meter walk I feel good and barely remember the pain from the middle of the night. It's not until I go to leave the cubical that my hands start to tingle and the chest pain comes again. I rest on the pedestrian barrier until the pain subsides sufficiently for me to move again. This is not good I think. The medic tent is round the corner I should probably go there. They check me out and the news is not good, concerned by my ECG readings they mobilise the site ambulance to take me to Leicester Royal Infirmary* 

I can hear Riff stirring in the cabin below so I head down and put the kettle on. He is up quickly to set up a GoPro to capture the sunrise next to the Rock of Gibraltar. Once it is warm, though there is not much wind, we try and play with the sails to get us into port but finally give up. We motor past big ships and their attached smaller refueling tankers thinking that the Rock's low tax fuel must be big business. Despite this, when we get to our Spanish Marina, just a few hundred meters north of the border,, we fill up on Spanish diesel. I'm happy to pay the small amount of tax to support our host country.
