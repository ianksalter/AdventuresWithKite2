# Vilamoura to Vila Real de Santo Antonio (Monday 2nd April 2018) #

My alarm is set for 5am but I spend a restless night and am fully awake at 4:30. While still in my cabin I get the latest weather reports and recheck the tides writing all this information in my temporary log book. 

The [International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (or COLREGS as it is also known)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea) mandates the keeping of a ships log. Somehow I have managed to mislay the logbook that I used in 2017. So now I keep three copies of the log. The first is written into a simple notebook. This is a temporary record and used anywhere inside the boat and outside in the cockpit, from where I suspect my original book may have been lost overboard. The second is stored on spreadsheets in the cloud, this includes the log of 2017 much of which I have managed to recreate from other documentation including my blogs. The third log is hand written in a book that lives in the chart table and is only taken out in port, to write up the formal log or to show to officialdom. 

I leave my cabin at 5, our agreed waking hour, and head to the marina facilities. When I get back I put the kettle on and start preparing the boat for sea. With coffee made I wake the rest of the crew. They are soon up and dressed. When they have made it back from the toilets, we call the marina on the radio. The marinherio soon arrives on a rib. We exchange our security passes and electricity cable for the 30 euros deposit, say our thank yous and sail away from Vilamoura into the night. It is 6.30 am. 

We have the fenders in and sails raided in no time. Keen to capture the sunrise and our days adventures on his Go Pro, Riff sets about rigging up a makeshift tripod by cable tying the ships broom the badck of the boat. With this done there is nothing much to do except keep and eye on the sails.
